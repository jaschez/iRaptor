# iRaptor: Development of a space-themed roguelite with procedural generated levels

In this work it is shown, through different phases, a complete videogame development process, inspired by many current roguelikes, with levels created by using procedural generation algorithms that are focused on an optimal level design and oriented to replayability, following an individual based software development methodology and a design pattern that facilitates the modularity and integration of the project.

Roguelite is a subgenre of video games based on the rogue-like genre that shares similar characteristics between each other (the levels change procedurally every time a new game is started, permanent death, high difficulty curve, player characteristics are improved throughout the game...), with the main addition that a progress in certain elements is perceived, which is saved and remains after losing in previous games. (this can translate to: new items available to be used in the next game, permanent enhancement of player characteristics, story and/or game narrative advance, etc.).

The agile development methodology applied to this project is based on a mix between Kanban and Scrum methodologies, oriented to solo dev workflow, consisting in assigning objectives from a ‘to-do’ list to a ‘doing’ list. This set of objectives would constitute a sprint, which would last 4-5 days, during which the development would focus exclusively on this list of tasks to be achieved and whose amount would depend on the cost of realization of each one, which is estimated at the start of each sprint based on the experience of previous sprints, thus providing feedback to the development cycle.
In addition, this methodology is associated with a branching strategy, thus identifying the progress made in each branch of the repository more easily,
apart from other advantages.

During the development process, some state-of-the-art tools and platforms commonly used in the videogame industry are used for this proyect, such as Unity 3D (Video Game Graphics Engine), Visual Studio (Integrated Development Environment), Github (Version Control), Trello (Project Planning), Aseprite (2D sprite editor and pixel-art tool), and FL Studio (sound effects and music production).
